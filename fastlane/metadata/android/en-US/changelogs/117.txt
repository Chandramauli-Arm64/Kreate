Fixed:
- Missing "Set cache location" in Data Settings
- "Source error" in AA
- App crashed when cache size set to 0 (disabled)
- "Theme mode" and "Theme" has the same options
- No option to select light mode

Changed:
- Hide cache indicator when it's disabled
- Apply marquee effect (scrolling text) to setting entries
